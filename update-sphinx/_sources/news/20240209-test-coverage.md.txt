The quality of Apps can be enhanced by thorough testing. Sometimes not only the test results, but also the amount of code covered by the test suite is of interest. This is addressed by the new section <a href="../howtos/testing_apps/testing_apps.html#running-app-tests-with-code-coverage">Running App tests with code coverage</a> of the chapter <a href="../howtos/testing_apps/testing_apps.html">Testing Apps</a>.
