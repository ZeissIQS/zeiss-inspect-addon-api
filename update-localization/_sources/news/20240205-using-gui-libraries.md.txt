The Add-on Editor and the Dialog Designer provide an easy and convenient way of adding a graphical user interface to your Add-on &mdash; see <a href="../python_api_introduction/user_defined_dialogs.md">User-defined dialogs</a>. GUIs which are created this way seamlessly integrate into the look and feel of ZEISS INSPECT. However, there are reasons why using a separate Python GUI library might be preferred. <a href="../howtos/using_gui_libraries/using_gui_libraries.html">Using an additional Python GUI library</a> gives a brief overview on use-cases, options and installation.
