In most cases, Python packages &mdash; also known as Python wheels &mdash; are installed as described in <a href="../howtos/using_add_on_editor/using_add_on_editor.html#installing-python-packages">Using the Add-on Editor - Installing Python Packages</a>.

In case this does not work, [Using Python wheelhouses](../howtos/using_wheelhouses/using_wheelhouses) can provide a solution.
