# App file format

## Introduction

ðŸ’¡ An ZEISS INSPECT App file (extension: *.addon) is a ZIP archive with pre-defined folder- and filenames. 

While an App file will be created and modified with the App Editor in most cases, it can also be unzipped/edited/zipped manually if necessary.

## Structure

### Content data

ðŸ’¡ Each "content object" consists of a folder in one of the "content type" (top level) folders.

* A "content object" is a single template/script/element/... distributed via an App.
* Each "content object" is represented by the content of a folder in the "content type" folder matching the content type.
* The exact format of the content representation depends on the "content type".
* The name of the "content object" is the same as its folder's name.
* For template-like objects, there is always a JSON file with administrative data present. Other types may vary.

#### Example: Labels

**Folder layout 'labels'**

```
metainfo.json
labels
|-- Name
|   |--Name.json
|-- Results
|   |-- Results.json
...
```

* The folder names 'Name' and 'Results' are the templates' names
* The JSON file in each folder contains both administrative data and content information

**Name.json**

```json
{
    "content": {
        "!all:" {
            "label_background": "gom.Color (0, 0, 0, 0)",
            "label_border_mode": "'none'",
            "...": "...",
            "label_text": "..."
        },
        "...": "..."
    },
    "sort_index": 1,
    "uuid": "4a6ef87a-5214-4089-bdc3-5a96cf8b5108"
}
```

#### Example: Scripts

**Folder layout 'scripts'**
```
scripts/
|-- Tools/
|   |-- Workspaces
|       |-- create_workspace.py
|       |-- create_workspace.metainfo
|-- ...
...
```

## FAQ

### Structure

#### Why is there a folder for every single element?
* The App Editor can handle the elements transparently in this way. Just the folder is dragged & dropped, visible etc., while the content is abstracted and can edited (e.g. in a graphical editor)
* The content format specification of an element can easier be changed over time
