With ZEISS INSPECT 2025, it is possible to add a dialog for selecting files or folders by using RMB ► Insert ► File... in the script editor. See <a href="../howtos/python_api_introduction/file_selection_dialog.html">Selecting a file or folder</a> for details. This serves as a shortcut to creating a <a href="../howtos/python_api_introduction/user_defined_dialogs.html">User-defined dialog</a> if only a single file widget is needed.
