# Add-On Documentation 2023

Welcome to the Add-On documentation. With Add-Ons, you will be able to customize and extend the functionality of your GOM Inspect software. 
You can include several template configurations from the software, as well as completely new workflows programmed in python.

```{important}
Creating add-ons is a rather advanced topic, so you should be familiar with the basic inspection concept of the GOM Software beforehand. New to GOM Inspect? This free course teaches you the basics:

[(eLearning) 780 Starter Training GOM Inspect](https://training.gom.com/home/LearningPath/7265)

Or, depending on your application, you might be interested in the specific starter trainings for [GOM Volume Inspect](https://training.gom.com/home/LearningPath/7280), [GOM Correlate](https://training.gom.com/home/LearningPath/7282), or [GOM Blade Inspect](https://training.gom.com/home/LearningPath/7281).

```

If you are new to add-ons, we recommend following our how-to guides to get you started.
