# Testing add-ons

```{note}
You can use the `Python API Examples` add-on, which you can find in the store, as an example how to include tests in your add-on.
```
## Why testing?

Testing your add-on is a crucial step for maintainability, especially when dealing with multiple software versions or updates. As manually testing your add-on is often tedious and time consuming, this how-to focuses on how to include **automated tests** in your add-on.

Automated tests are important when writing add-ons in Python because they help to ensure the code is running correctly and efficiently. Furthermore, they can be used to ensure that the code is compatible with different versions of the GOM Software, as well as on different machines. Finally, automated tests can be used to improve the overall performance of the add-on, as well as to ensure it meets the userâ€™s requirements.

## File structure

For test discovery to work, the file and folder structure of add-on tests needs to adhere to the following conventions, which are similar to the *pyTest*s [Conventions for Python test discovery](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/explanation/goodpractices.html#conventions-for-python-test-discovery).

* test script file names **start with `test_`**
* test scripts *only* contain **functions with the prefix `test_`**.
   * this means: no code outside of function definitions. 
* (optional, but recommended) all python test scripts reside in a separate `tests/` directory of your add-ons top-level directory.

```{note}
In ZEISS Inspect 2023, there is no need anymore for a script at the top-level that executes all of your tests. Instead, use the "Execute add-on tests" command (see [Running tests](#running-add-on-tests)).
```

## Writing a test script

The following steps are required to write a new test script. The example code is taken from the `Python API Examples` add-on, which you can find in the store.

1. Create a test script: Create a Python file with the convention test_*.py. 
   (Example: `PythonApiExamples/tests/test_data_interfaces_check_results`)
   
2. Import the module or package to be tested: Import the module or package that you want to test.

   ```python
   # Importing the example we want to test
   import PythonApiExamples.examples.data_interfaces.check_results_data_array as example
   ```
   
   For this to work properly, the code that you want to test needs to be structured in functions as well. In this case, the functions `get_single_result_value()` of the `check_results_data_arrray` script is imported.
   For more details, see also: [How the examples are structured](../../python_examples/index.md#how-the-examples-are-structured).
   
3. Write test functions: Write test functions named with prefix `test_` that define expected behavior. For simple checks for expected values, use the `assert` statement like shown below. For more complex test data (like arrays or Element properties), see [Working with test data](#working-with-test-data).

   ```python
   def test_check_results ():
     # Setup test project
     open_project('gom_part_test_project')
     test_element = gom.app.project.inspection['Surface comparison 1']
     
     # Test definition
     expected_single_value = 2.0495047569274902
     actual_result_value = example.get_single_result_value(test_element)
     
     assert actual_result_value == expected_single_value
   ```

That's all it takes to create a simple test, which can now be run.

## Running add-on tests

To run add-on tests, either a single one or multiple/all tests of an add-on, you can use the integrated script editor or VSCode. You can also execute tests from a script.
### Using the script editor

To run the tests of a specific test script, use the context menu and select "Run tests...". 

![](execute_tests_command.jpg)

You can use this context also on higher levels of the file hierarchy, e.g. to execute all tests of a folder or of the complete add-on.

Results will be shown in the log of the script editor.

![](test_log.jpg)

### Using VSCode

The Zeiss inspect add-on extension for VSCode was also extended to be able to run the test functions separately, or a collection of tests.
To use this feature, navigate to the "Testing" workspace of VSCode and select the test items you want to run.

### From scripts

You can use the `execute_addon_tests` command to run tests of an add-on. It takes the add-on UUID as mandatory argument. If solely given, all tests of the add-on are executed. You can also provide a list of test paths with the argument `test_paths` in form of relative paths inside the add-on. The suffix `#test_<...>` indicates, which test function to run. 

```
results = gom.script.sys.execute_addon_tests_draft(addon_uuid='5f396cc9-7865-44a1-8a85-ed7c1689dd68')
```

```
results = gom.script.sys.execute_addon_tests_draft(addon_uuid='5f396cc9-7865-44a1-8a85-ed7c1689dd68', 
	test_paths=['/PythonApiExamples/tests/test_dialog_widgets_explorer_selection#test_explorer_selection'])
```
This will give you `results` as a list of tuples (test name, success, error message), which you can use for further evaluation.


## Working with test data

In the namespace `addon`, there are two new classes: `addon.ArrayDataTest` and `addon.ElementTest`.

These classes can help you to create test data and compare the data of the current test run with the saved data. An example usage is given by `test_data_interfaces_volume_section.py` of the Python API Examples add-on.

```
from addon import ArrayDataTest, ElementTest
from PythonApiExamples.setup_project import open_project

# Importing the example we want to test
import PythonApiExamples.examples.data_interfaces.volume_section_image_data as example

def test_volume_section():
	# Setup test project
	open_project('volume_test_project')
	test_element = gom.app.project.actual_elements['Plane X +40.00 mm']
	#
	# TEST
	#
	element_test = ElementTest('test_data/data_interfaces_volume_section_tokens.dat')
	element_test.testElementValues(test_element, ['image_width', 'image_height', 'image_type'])
	element_test.callTest()

	raw_array = example.get_image_data_raw(test_element)
	raw_array_test = ArrayDataTest('test_data/data_interfaces_volume_section_raw.dat')
	raw_array_test.testArrayValues(raw_array)

	rgb_array = example.get_image_data_rgb(test_element)
	rgb_array_test = ArrayDataTest('test_data/data_interfaces_volume_section_rgb.dat')
	rgb_array_test.testArrayValues(rgb_array)
```

You can see, that `ElementTest` can be used to access element properties easily. `ArrayDataTest` is used for `numpy` array comparison.
The path, where test data is stored, is supplied in the constructors (e.g. `ElementTest('test_data/data_interfaces_volume_section_tokens.dat')`).
If a relative path is given, like here, a resource inside the add-on is created / compared with. You can also use absolute paths to a file on your disk, but this is not recommended since not everyone that installed your add-on has access to this test data.

These classes will **create the test data** for you, if you run the test execution via "Run tests (create data)...".

In a "normal" test run, data will be compared to the stored resources.
