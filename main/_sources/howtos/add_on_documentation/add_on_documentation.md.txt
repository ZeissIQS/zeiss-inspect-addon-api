## Add-on structure

An add-on file is technically a ZIP file.

* It must at least contain a file `doc\README.md`, which will be rendered as the product's splash description ad.
* It can contain an arbitrary number of additional files in the `doc` folder referenced from within the `README.md` file. 

### Example

* Documentation related content of the add-on 'Python API Examples':

* The README.md is the starting point for rendering the add-ons splash description and will reference all other files:

* This will result in the following splash description:
