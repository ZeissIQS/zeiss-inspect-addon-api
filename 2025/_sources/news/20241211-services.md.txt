In ZEISS INSPECT 2025, services have been introduced. A ZEISS INSPECT service is a Python script running continuously in the background, which exposes API functions to other scripts. Services can be distributed via Apps and can be used as computation kernels or callback targets. See <a href="../howtos/using_services/using_services.html">Using services</a> and <a href="../python_api/python_api.html#gom-api-services">Service API</a> for details.
